Step 1: Create a Batch File

    Open Notepad: Start a new text document in Notepad.

    Write the Batch Script: Enter the following lines, replacing path_to_your_script.py with the full path to your Python script.

    batch

		@echo off
		python "C:\path\to\your\script.py"
		pause

    Save the File: Save the file with a .bat extension, for example, run_script.bat.

Step 2: Create a Shortcut to the Batch File

    Locate the Batch File: Navigate to where you saved your .bat file.
    Right-Click the Batch File: Select "Create shortcut."
    Move the Shortcut: Drag the shortcut to the desktop or right-click it and select "Pin to taskbar."

Step 3: Modify Shortcut Properties (Optional)

    Right-Click the Shortcut: Select "Properties."
    Change Icon: Click "Change Icon" to select a custom icon if desired.
    Set Start In Directory: Under the "Shortcut" tab, set the "Start in" field to the directory where your Python script is located. This is important for relative paths.

Step 4: Run the Script

You can now click the shortcut on your taskbar to run your Python script. The command prompt will open, run the script, and remain open until you press a key (due to the pause command).

Notes

    Ensure Python is added to your system's PATH variable so that it can be called from any directory else replace python with "C:\path\to\your\python.exe".
    You can also use a virtual environment for your script by activating it in the batch file before calling the Python script.
